## Options ##

### Make SPACE mandatory before each session ###

Unchecking this and not starting texts by pressing space will reduce the accuracy (very slightly) of the measurements for the first key, word, and trigram of every text.

### Automatically review slow and mistyped words after texts ###

All the words you mistyped as well as the 25% slowest words will be taken from the text and Amphetype will use the lesson generation settings you have set on the Lesson Generator tab to auto-generate a lesson on the fly for review. These will be added to the `<Reviews>` source.
