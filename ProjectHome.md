Amphetype is a layout-agnostic typing program aimed at people who don't need an on-screen keyboard, but would still like to improve their speed and accuracy.

Some features:

  * WPM, accuracy, and viscosity (as the opposite of fluidity) statistics on texts, words, keys, and trigrams. Historical data can be grouped in several different ways (by days, averages of 10, etc.).
  * You can generate text fragments to type from [Project Gutenberg](http://gutenberg.net) or any other plain text source to practice typing with your favorite novel. There's even an option that lets you type texts in order, fragment by fragment. Read a book with your fingers!
  * Advanced lesson generation: auto-review slow and mistyped words after every text or generate custom lessons to practice problem words, keys, trigrams, etc.
  * Graphs!
  * `[Your suggestions here!]`

```
Linux users: just check out the sources
OS X users: halter73 has provided me with an (Intel) OS X build,
            if there are any problems please report it in the issue list.
            (If anyone can help providing updated builds using py2app,
            please let me know.)
```

For an online webapp alternative, check out the excellent <a href='http://www.keyhero.com/'>Key Hero</a>. I plan to steal some of its nicer features. :) (However, the future focus of Amphetype will be advanced analysis and better lesson generation.)
